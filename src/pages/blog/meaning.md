I have been searching for the meaning of life for the last 2 years.

Lot of seeking.

Lot of thinking.

And I just can't find anything.

There is no meaning of life hardcoded in reality.

So I have decided to make one myself. And I am going to stick to this for my rest of my life untill I find something better.

And here is it.

Create passionately, live fearlessly, spread  love, be open to the unknown and never fool yourselves.

* Create passionately - I will build only products out of passion. I should be genuinely excited about building the product. I should be happy the product exist in the world and I helped make that happen.

* Live fearlessly - Act assuming things will go right. Don't act out of fear of failure. Do things that I want to do courageouly. It's okay if I fail. This ofcourse does not mean I am going to free solo El Capitan tomorrow. That would be stupid.

* Spread love - Build products that spread love. Do things that bring joy to others. Act with kindness.

* Be open to the unknown - Embrace the unknown. Develop a relationship with it. Don't run away from it.

* Don't fool myself - I have fooled myself many times. Sometimes I believed my own lies for years. Make sure I am not fooling myself.
