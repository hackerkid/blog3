Here is the list of the best purchases I have made in no particular order.

1. RC 120 - I got this road bike bought shortly after I moved to London. I cycle to office in it. It helped me see a lot of places that I would have never seen or been in London. I even cycled to Paris from London on it.

2. Amazon Alexa Echo Dot - I set alarm on it. Play music on it. Set daily reminders to help me form new habits. Set timers for meditation.

3. LogiTech Mx Master - All other mouses I have tried including Apple mouse sucks in front of it. It's super fast.

4. Water Dental Flosser - Got me into flossing regularly. Easy to use.

5. Kindle - I bought my first Kindle almost 10 years back. I have read countless book in them. And many of them changed me forever.

6. [Cycling Double Pannier Rack Backpack](https://www.decathlon.co.uk/p/27-l-cycling-double-pannier-rack-backpack-green-grey/347894/c311m8808911) - This is a backpack that you can carry to your office. But it also splits into two halves and you can attach it in your pannier rack of your cycle. So you can use it for doing multi day cycling trips as well to buy grocerries. 

7. Asics GT Running shoes - When I started to get into running I initially went on a run with a Nike shoes that I had. It was painful. Then I went to Runner's need and got a running test. They recommended me the Asics GT running shoes based on how I run. My mind was blown away when I tried running on. They are so comfy to run on. And that's how I got into running.

8. Postit todo notes - Postit todo notes are a bit expensive. But they are super sticky and rarely fall down. I stick them in my wall. I mainly use them for habit tracking.

9. UK Rail Card - The UK 26 - 30 railcard gives you serious discounts in national rail and tube journeys. This is by far the winner if it comes just to money saved.

10. Football - I got a football shortly after moving to London. It was initially used to just play with 1 or 2 friends. But when it was played last before it completely worn out it was used in games with 10+ people regularly.

11. [Breville Smoothie maker](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0891XPJVF?th=1) - Dirt cheap. I use it to make smnoothies and even my own version of Guaconole.

12. [Hanging Wardrobe Closet Storage](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B08L9HTGXG?th=1) - This is a super cheap hanging closet storage that I put inside the wardrobe. It saved me so much time since it makes retrievel of clothes super fast.
