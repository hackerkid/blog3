It's hard to find another blog that have as many good ideas like Paul Graham's.

He has a lot of good ideas to write because of his experience working closely with hundreds of startups when he was running [YCombinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/).

But I don't think this is what makes his blog great.

I think it is error correction.

Paul Graham, despite his experience with startups, is still a human and prone to bad ideas. And he knows that.

If you have read Paul's blog, you must have noticed a footer section in which he thanks the people who read
the draft.

The drafts are often reviewed by individuals like Sam Altman, Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, Collisson brothers, John Carmack etc who themselves have a lot of good ideas.

They do error correction of bad ideas during the draft review.

So most blog posts that we get to read are error corrected and contains only good ideas.
