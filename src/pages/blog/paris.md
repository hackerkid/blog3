### Day 1

We started the ride from London Eye on around 8 AM on Saturday, November 8, 2025.

The destination for day 1 was Newhaven, where we have a ferry for France to catch around 5 PM.

It's around 100KM to Newhaven from London.

It was my first time doing such a distance with a time constraint.

So naturally I was a bit worried whether we would make it on time to catch the ferry.

Luckily there was no rain or any unseen problems.

One of the main challenges in this section of the journey is the hills.

There are many small and big hills on the way.

Also there is very little cycle lane and you have cycle for hours alongside cars.

 We reached Newhaven by around 3 PM.

 We got to the ferry on time and reached Dieppe by around 10:00 PM.

 We checked into our Airbnb in Dieppe which had cycling racks for all the bikes.
 
 Then went on to have a nice Kebab for dinner

### Day 2

We started ride at around 9 PM after getting breakfast from a local bakery in Dieppe.

We knew we had a long day in front of us since we had to cover around 110 KM that day before we reached Gysors.

One of the pleasant things that was waiting for us in then morning was a cycling lane that was completely detached from any roads.

It seemed like the cycling path was built by converting an old railyway line into a bike path.

This meant we could cycle without worrying about cars.

We also found a nice Creppe place by the cycling path. Prevously the building where the Creppe restaurant was located used to be a railway station.

We cycled for probably 50 KMs in the cycling path.

Rest of the journey was mostly by the roads with a little bit of cycling path.

There were some big hills towards the end of the day.

We also had to cycle a bit in the dark.

We arrived at Gisors around 6 PM.

We had a good dinner from a Kebab restaurant and went into the accomodation for night.

The house we were staying didn't had any bike storage so we had to put our bikes in the living room.

### Day 3

The next day, we noticed one of the bikes had a puncture.

Initially, we thought the bike had tubeless tires and need to take it to Decathlon.

But later we realized it supports tubeless but has tube in it.

So we tried to change it by ouurselves. We were struggling a bit when a local French man showed up and changed the tube for us.

After having the breakfast and stocking up some food from super market and bakery, we headed towards Paris.

This was the shortest leg of the journey and we had to cover under 100km.

Thw weather was mostly good except for some slight rain and by evening we reached Paris.

We finished our trip in front of Eiffel Tower.

We then went to have some hot chocolate and headed to our hotels.

### Some takeaways
* Make sure that you load up enough food for the day. Expect that you might not find anywhere to eat when you want to.
* Don't bother much about letting cars pass by while cycling. They will figure out a way to pass. Prioratize your own safety and wellbeing.
* Carry spare tubes and a pump.
* Wear high visibility jackets.
* If you have sticky helmet camera mounts, make sure they are sticky enough to survice such long distances.
* Electrolite tablets seemed helpful.
* I found Bananas to help with energy levels and well being. Though I don't have enough data point.
* Carry a light weight lock.
* Get tyres changed if you have been using them for a while.
