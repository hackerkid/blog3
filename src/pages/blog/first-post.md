I have decided to start writing blogs again.

So I have setup this new blog using [Astro](https://astro.build/).

Previosuly I have used Wordpress, Jekyll and Ghost for my blogs.

Hopefully I am going to stick with Astro for a while.

But that seems unlikely given my history ;)

My old blog archive is acessible in this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/hackerkid/blog).
