Almost 6 month back, I came across this tweet from Sam Altman.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">absolute equivalence of brahman and atman</p>&mdash; Sam Altman (@sama) <a href="https://twitter.com/sama/status/1607482407770554373?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 26, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I had no idea what he was talking about when he meant Atman and Brahman is equivalent.

So I started reading more about this.

Atman in this context is the soul or consciousness of an Individual self.

Brahman refers to the fundamental reality in which everything appears.

So according to his tweet, the individual consciousness is the same as the fundamental reality.

This translates to consciousness is the only entity that exists. And everything appears on it.

This is also called non duality and is a popular spiritual philosophy in many eastern cultures.

This is different from the materialistic view where matter is fundamental and gives rise to consciousness.

I also started doing meditation at this time.

The more I do meditation, the more I am sliding towards the non duality philosophy.

To add to all, pioneers of quantum mechanics like Erwin Schr√∂dinger, Niels Bohr etc was also into similar ideas.

These days, I am going through many books to learn more about this idea.

Some books that I am reading are
* Toas of Physics
* Be as You Are: The Teachings of Ramana Maharishi
* On Having No Head

I think personally this idea has helped me become more calm and peaceful.
