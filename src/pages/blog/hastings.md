I got an open return ticket to Hastings(Rye is on the way) from Stratford and boarded one of the South Eastern Javelin trains.

The hike itself was quite scenic. It was also a sunny day which helped.

There were hardly any restaurants or shops on the way. Luckily I packed some sandwiches and water which helped during the hike.

I followed mostly the road signs during the hike and didn't properly follow any hiking guide. So I ended up going through the Royal Military Canal instead of going by the sea in the second half.

I used Strava to track whether I am more or less going in the right direction.

On the the way back I got train back from Rye.

This ended up as one of my favorite hikes I have done close to London.
