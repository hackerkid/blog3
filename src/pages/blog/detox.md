I would be going to use Internet only to get things done for a month.

This means I won't be using the Internet for

1. Watching videos or movies. This includes YouTube, Instagram, Apple TV etc.

2. I won't be using Twitter

I have blocked thee sites on laptop using [Site Blocker Panda](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/site-blocker-panda/hnekbenciimgdilimapcjnaonmfnjfdb) which is a chrome extension I built.

In phone I uninstalled these apps. And I disabled chrome and Samsung Internet so that I don't use the web to access them. And I kept Firefox with a siteblocker blocking these apps as my only Browser.

3. I won't listen to any Podcasts.

4. Slack is another source of distraction. I will check Slack only once every 60 mins. And I would restrict the channels only to direct work related. I would check the social channels during the lunch hours.

5. I will check the work email only right before work, during lunch and before I sign off. 

6. I would spend the extra time outside working hours on books,  programming or even doing more outdoor things.

7. I am allowed to use websites that help me get work done like GitHub, ChatGPT etc.

8. I am allowed to use apps like Whatsapp that allows me stay in touch with friends and family.

9. I am allowed to spend 15 mins on Hacker News per day after I finish working on any side project. But the catch is I am only allowed to use the Lynx terminal browser for accessing it so that I don't mindlessly scroll on it.

I plan re evaluate what I should bring back to my life after finishing the 30 days.
