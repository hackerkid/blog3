1. Start a timer and start working.

2. If you get distracted
    * Stop the timer.
    * Record the duration of the session.
    * Go back to Step 1.

Here is an example

|Session| Duration|
|----|----|
|1| 3 mins 21 seconds|
|2| 5 mins 10 seconds|
|3| 22 mins 54 seconds|
|5|33 mins 20 seconds|

You might be surprised by the results.

### Notes
1. Checking email, slack etc count as distracted if you are Programming.
2. It's easy to get distracted. You need to put a lot of effort not to.
3. Generally the longer undistracted I can go, the better the quality of the work.
4. Tracking the session duration gamifies deepwork. With a well defined score to beat your mind encouraged to focus more intensely on beating it.
