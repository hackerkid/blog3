I ran my first Half Marathon today!

I was not really expecting to run a half marathon when I went for running.

But I am reading this book called Mindset which encourages learning and embracing failures instead of trying to look smart by never trying hard things and hence not loosing.

So I decided to see how much I can push myself.

The running water bottle that I recently bought from Decathlon really helped. Would have been impossible without the water. I also had to refill the bottle inbetween by running into a Tesco.
