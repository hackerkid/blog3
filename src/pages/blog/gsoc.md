I spent this summer doing [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) with [Zulip](https://zulip.org). This blog post summarizes the work that I did. All my work was to improve or add new features to the [Zulip server](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/). As a result I was able to work on a multitude of areas covering frontend, backened, management commands etc.

## Merged Pull Requests

* Except for the first table all other tables list pull requests that are aimed at solving one problem. The first tables lists pull requests that are independent of each other.
* Note that all the pull requests listed in this section are merged. But most of them have closed label on it as Zulip merges pull requests manually.
